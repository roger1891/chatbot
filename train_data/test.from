Speedfan can give an insanely inaccurate reading on certain motherboards, so you can't always trust it. I just don't want you to think that your low end processor/vid card is running at 100C, because I really doubt that it is.

Well, putting it on the lift to do the oil and tire repair makes sense. It is way easier to get access to drain the oil and replace the oil filter when the car is raised up. Same goes for repairing the tire. The rest is just bullshit though.

'coming out of the closet' would mean to defy a social norm publicly. Why it's been tied to atheism lately is beyond me. I find it moronic actually. That's like growing up and 'coming out the closet' that you're a Vegan. Trust me, nobody gives a fuck.
